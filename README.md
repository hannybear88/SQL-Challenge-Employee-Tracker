# SQL-Challenge-Employee-Tracker
HW Challenge #12

## Description
<!-- For this challenge we had to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end has already been created and provided by UCSD Coding Bootcamp. It's our job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

It was challenging to build the back-end and connect it to the front-end. Even though it was challenging, it was quite enjoyable. I like making notes to myself because it helps me with reminding myself what I have coming up, what I need to do for the day, week, any events that are coming up, and etc. Another challenge I ran into was figuring out how to deploy it onto Heroku. It had failed which was frustrating because it was working fine everywhere else. I finally was able to figure it out.

 I had successfully deployed the app on Heroku, the app has no errors in the console, and there are no errors in the app itself.  -->
